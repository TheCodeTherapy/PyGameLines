# PyGameLines

This is a simple graphical "toy" that I wrote to teach my son a little bit about programming logic, and also to remember (in a nostalgic sense) the first programs I wrote in my life when I was his age (10 years old, programming Applesoft's BASIC on my first computer, an Apple IIe).

It uses PyGame lib and the array of lines it draws can be controlled with the 3 mouse buttons.

Right button: delete a line from the line arrays
Middle button: wait for pygame.event so the next frame can be drawn
Left button: adds a new line to the lines array, and also make the closest point of the first line to follow the mouse cursor

Mouse cursor needs to be focused so you can interact with the lines.
